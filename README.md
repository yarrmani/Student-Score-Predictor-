## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Columns:**
  - `Hours_Studied` â†’ Number of hours a student studied  
  - `Exam_Score` â†’ Final exam score

## ðŸ”§ What This Project Does
1. Uploads and reads the dataset in **Google Colab**.  
2. Checks for missing values and basic statistics.  
3. Visualizes the relationship between hours studied and exam scores.  
4. Splits data into **training** and **testing** sets.  
5. Trains a **Linear Regression** model.  
6. Predicts exam scores and evaluates model performance.  
7. Plots **Actual vs Predicted Scores** for easy comparison.
